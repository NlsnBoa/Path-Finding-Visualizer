# Pathfinding Visualizer

Pathfinding Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to help you visualize and understand common pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra's, Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, and A-star. You can create custom mazes and obstacles to see how these algorithms behave in various scenarios. Built using React.js, TypeScript, CSS, and HTML, this tool is perfect for beginners and experts alike to gain deeper insights into pathfinding algorithms.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of popular pathfinding algorithms:
  - Dijkstra's
  - Breadth-First Search
  - Depth-First Search
  - A-star
- Ability to create custom mazes and obstacles
- Intuitive user interface for ease of use
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14.x.x or higher)
